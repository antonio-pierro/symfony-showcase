### Introduction

This course is an introduction to web development with Symfony2.  

It consists of PRs where you can follow the creation of a complete web application from scratch and step by step: a blog, including an administration area.

The course is globally structured this way:  

* Setting up the development environment 
* Generating the core bundle for the public part (frontend) 
* Generating the model bundle for the business logic (interactions with the database) 
* Generating the administration bundle, to manage posts and authors (backend or backoffice) 
* Refactoring code to modularize and organize it better, using the flexibility of the service container 

I will emphasize test driven development, using the industry standard: PHPUnit.  
If you are a PHP developer and you want to step up to the next level using a framework, or if you already know Symfony or another framework and you want to review and go in depth, this is your course. 
An introduction that will give you the tools to create an application easily, making use of good practices.
